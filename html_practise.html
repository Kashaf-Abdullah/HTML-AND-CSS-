<p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.[2] Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.[2][3] Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:</p>
<h3>Function and target</h3>
<p>A computer programming language is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation[4] or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots,[5] and so on. For example, PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language.[6] In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way.[7] Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.</p>
